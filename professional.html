            <h3>Bringing Large-scale Analytical Breakthroughs Laboratory (Blablablab, Ann Arbor, MI)</h3>
            <p><strong>Research Intern - Large Language Models and Spatial LLMs</strong> | August 2023 - Present</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Web Scraping popular platforms like Yelp and Yellow Pages, utilizing Google Maps API to generate 55 million routes around Ann Arbor used for supervised learning model training data.</li>
                <li>Training flan-T5 to respond to landmark-driven routing. Model aims to respond with accurate routine turns without hallucinations. Benchmarking performance via PIQA and personalized dataset to be published in XAI datasets.</li>
                <li>Prompt and probe engineering to discern which layers of flan-T5 correspond to spatial cognizance, specifically trying to gauge which layer(s) the model can discern navigation turns. Tracking spatial loss across multiple layers as well as spatiality through global and local neighbor algorithms.</li>
                <li>Creating performance metrics via Jaccard Indexing to gauge model’s performance in “turning” at correct locations. Thorough parsing of model outputs to filter for intersection between agreement of model performance and model output over total model outputs.</li>
                <li>Collaborating with interdisciplinary teams, participating in group discussions, and contributing to the development of innovative solutions for large-scale analytical challenges.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Computational Vascular Biomechanics Laboratory (Ann Arbor, MI)</h3>
            <p><strong>Research Assistant - Research and Development</strong> | December 2022 - June 2023</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spearheaded left coronary artery generator using NumPy, expanding AngioNet's dataset.</li>
                <li>Designed Python script with NumPy and Matplotlib to compare Real vs. Synthetic Left Coronary Trees. Deduced optimal branch rotation angles, generating physiologically accurate synthetic data for research and training.</li>
                <li>Utilized YOLOv5 and stenosis weights for precise stenosis localization in deidentified angiograms. This generated new data that would be used to fine-tune the deep learning model. Achieved 15% reduction in false positives during stenosis detection using cropping techniques for PatchAngioNet training.</li>
                <li>Contributed to data analysis and interpretation, presenting findings in lab meetings and collaborating on potential improvements to existing methodologies.</li>
                <li>Participated in the planning and execution of experiments, ensuring compliance with research protocols and maintaining accurate records of experimental data.</li>
